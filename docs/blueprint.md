# **App Name**: RiskLens

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Risk Index: Shows a real-time risk index (0–100) for companies or sectors, blending stock volatility, macroeconomic shifts, and sentiment from financial news.
- Risk Heatmap: Displays a color-coded heatmap of score changes across companies/sectors over the last 90 days. Green = stable, Yellow = moderate risk, Red = high risk.
- Driver Breakdown: A radial (donut) chart highlights the percentage impact of each factor category (Market, Macro, Sentiment, Liquidity).
- Narrative Evidence Cards: Evidence cards with headline + sentiment score + tagged factor (e.g., “Liquidity Risk ↑ due to negative RBI policy news”).
- Scenario Explorer: Lets users apply macro-level shocks (e.g., +2% interest rate, –5% FX, +10% commodity price) and see how the risk index reacts across all entities.
- Smart Alerts: An intelligent alert system that not only shows score changes >8 points but also labels the type of trigger (Market vs Macro vs Sentiment).
- Plain-English Insights: Generates a narrative like: “Risk score rose from 62 → 74 due to higher volatility and negative news sentiment around liquidity tightening.”
